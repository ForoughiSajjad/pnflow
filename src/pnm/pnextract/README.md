##  pnextract -- (classical) pore-network extraction

This code extracts a conventional pore network from a micro-CT image.
It is a re-write of the maximal-ball network extraction algorithm by [Dong and Blunt, 2009]. 
It is used as a base for the generalized network extraction code 
[Raeini, Bijeljic and Blunt 2017], sponsored by [TOTAL]. However, here the modules
for extracting the generalized network elements (corners) are not included.   
The network parameters has been calibrated to reproduce single-phase flow 
properties, and water-wet relative permeability for a set of sandstone rocks.
The code uses a new scale-independent shape factor definition to characterize
pores and throats, published in [Bultreys et al. 2018].


### Instructions
A sample input file, Image.mhd, is provided in the doc folder, in ascii 
(text) format. Please use this file together with a 8-bit micro-CT 
image, similar to the [images on our website].

To extract a pore network, decompress the pnextract.exe.7z and run, in a Windows Command Prompt:     
    pnextract.exe  Image.mhd

See the [pnextract wiki](https://github.com/aliraeini/pnextract/wiki/pnextract-FAQ) for more instructions!

###  Compiling
The code is already compiled to bin/pnextract.exe, a Windows (win64) executable, using MinGW compilers.

The compilation can be done in Linux by running ``make`` command in the top-level directory.

###  Dependencies
The included voxelImage library  is the main prerequisite. 
voxelImage itself can optionally be linked to [libz] and [libtiff] to support
reading .raw.gz and 3D .tif files. 
Stripped down versions of both of these libraries are provided in the 
thirdparty directory for compatibility and ease of compilation.

###  Licence

The code and executables are provided as is, without any kind of warranty;
use at your own risk.
