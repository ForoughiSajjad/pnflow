# libvoxel commands

The following are commands will be processed by libvoxel when reading images.  They shall be given in after  ElementDataFile keyword in the .mhd files to avoid incompatibility with Fiji-is-ImageJ and Paraview.  Furthermore, any additional application specific keywords shall be provided after these since libvoxel stops processing the commands once it encounters any unrecognised keyword (i.e. other than comments and keywords below).  

The list of supported commands by libvxel can be obtained from voxelImageProcess app by running:    

		voxelImageProcess ?

Specific commands usage can be shown by running:

		voxelImageProcess ? command


Note these are in additional to the mhd header data provided in the top of .mhd files:

		ObjectType =  Image
		NDims =       3
		ElementType = MET_UCHAR
		ElementByteOrderMSB = False

		DimSize =    	1000	1000	1000
		ElementSize = 	1.6 	1.6 	1.6
		Offset =      	0   	0   	0

		ElementDataFile = Image.raw.gz

		//HeaderSize = 0 
		//CompressedData = True
		//OutputFormat = .raw.gz // alias for  DefaultImageFormat, not part of MHD specification

Additional MHD rules:

- The order of the first 6 keywords should not be changed for compatibility with third-party software (ImageJ and Paraview).    
- Use `#` or  `//` for commenting and deactivating commads/lines.    
- Each keyword and its data should be given in a single line.   This is because libvoxel currently does not rely on the more user friendly InputFile.h syntax, used by pnextract and pnflow ... codes.  
- Libvoxel detects only basic data/keywords provided in Image.am files and Image.tif files, without the need for a .mhd file. However, the commands bellow can only be provided in a separate .mhd (text) file, in which the name of Image.tif or Image.am file is given as an argument to ElementDataFile keyword (see above).


------------------------------------

## Basic commands

**threshold**:    
    Same as  selectPore   
 
		threshold  0  150

**threshold101**:    
    Same as  selectPore,  101 means inside the range will be set to zero and outside to 1

**direction**:    
    Re-interprets the image direction so that the flow direction becomes in the given  direction

    Crops the image, from a lower I, J, K and before an upper bound I J K values
 
		crop   100 100 0   900 900 1000

**resampleMean**:    
    Resamples the image while setting the new values to the mean of original voxel values in case of refining (ratio<1)   

		resampleMean   2

**resampleMax**:    
    Resample the image while setting the new values to the max of original voxels in case of refining (ratio<1)

**modeFilter**:    
    Apply  few iterations (first argument) of mode filter, reject mode if frequency less than  second argument   
 
		modeFilter      1       2    // 1 iterations, 2 for the threshold mode frequency to change a voxel

**medianFilter**:    
    Apply a median filter  
 
		medianFilter   1

**medianX**:    
    Apply few iterations of  median filter  only in x direction ( can help reduce file size of grey images when compressed) 
 
		medianX       1

    Median filter over 6 closest adjacent voxels
 
		FaceMedian06   1 

**PointMedian032**:    
    Median filter over 32 closest adjacent voxels
    
		PointMedian032   1  //<- one iterations

**mapFrom**:    
    Assigns voxel values from another image based on their physical location (X0+ijk*dX).  Image offsets should be assigned correctly.
 
		mapFrom "image_name.mhd"   ;
		mapFrom "image_name.mhd"  0 65536  0  0  ; //<- \[vv_min vv_max\] increase-factor shift  


**operation**:    
    Apply a mathematical unary (!, &, ~) or binary (+, -, \*, b, e).  Here b stands for begin or min and e stands for maximum or end for voxel values.  The second argument shall be empty in case of unary operations, or a number or an image file name in case of binary operators.     
 
		operation   + 10               //<- add 10 to voxel values
		operation   + image2.mhd -50   //<- -50 is a shift value to avoid overfow/capping
		operation   b 1                //<- set voxel values below <10 to 10
		operation   e 250              //<- set voxel values above 250> to 250

**operat**:    
    operat is an alias for `operation` keyword
